## Abstract

House price forecasting is an important topic of real estate. The literature attempts to derive useful knowledge from historical data of property markets. Machine learning techniques are applied to analyze historical property transactions in India to discover useful models for house buyers and sellers.Moreover, experiments demonstrate that the Multiple Linear Regression that is based on mean squared error measurement is a competitive approach.


## Aim
• Create an effective price prediction model
<br> 
• Validate the model’s prediction accuracy.
<br> 
• Identify the important home price ttributes     which feed the model’s predictive power.

## Data Selection
Data selection is defined as the process of determining the appropriate data type and source, as well as suitable instruments to collect data. Data selection precedes the actual practice of data collection.
